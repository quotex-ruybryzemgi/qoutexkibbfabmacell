## What are Candle Shadows?

Candle shadows are the thin lines that extend above and below the body
of a candle. They represent the highest and lowest prices that the asset
reached during the period represented by the candle.

The length of the shadows can provide valuable insights into the
strength of the bulls and bears. A long upper shadow indicates that the
bulls were strong, but were unable to sustain their momentum. A long
lower shadow indicates that the bears were strong, but were unable to
break the support level.

## Types of Candle Shadows

There are four main types of candle shadows:

-   **Upper shadows:** Indicate that the bulls were strong, but were
    unable to sustain their momentum.
-   **Lower shadows:** Indicate that the bears were strong, but were
    unable to break the support level.
-   **Long upper and lower shadows:** Indicate that the market is
    indecisive, and that neither the bulls nor the bears are in control.
-   **Wide range candles:** Indicate that the market is volatile, and
    that there is a large spread between the high and low prices.
